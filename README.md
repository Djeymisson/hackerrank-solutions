# hackerrank-solutions
Solutions for some HackerRank's challenges I solved.

The challenge's solutions are separated by modules and some file for tests are inside of the _input_files_ folder, they were made using the tests cases provide by the HackerRank plataform.

Inside of folder _certification_tests_ are solutions for certifications test problems, not include in any module.
